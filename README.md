# Machine Learning Repository
Welcome to the Machine Learning Repository, which contains various resources for building and training machine learning models. This repository includes datasets, pre-processing scripts, model architectures, and evaluation tools that aid in the development of machine learning workflows.


## Overview
**This repository contains a collection of deep learning templates organized into three main categories:**
- **Scoville Chili Analysis**
- **Water Drinkability Prediction**
- **Liver Disease Stage Prediction**

Each category includes Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts designed for easy experimentation and application.

### 1. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- **Folder:** [water](water/)
- **Description:** This project provides a template for implementing a RandomForestClassfier manually in Python without using built in functions for model training. It covers Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Model Training, and Evaluation.
- **Files Included:**
  - `water_template.ipynb`: Interactive Jupyter Notebook for exploring the random forest implementation.
  - `water_template.py`: Python script for running the random forest model in a standalone environment.
